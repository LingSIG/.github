This is the GitHub home of the [TEI Special Interest Group "TEI for Linguists"](https://tei-c.org/activities/sig/tei-for-linguists/) (LingSIG).

The pinned TEI repository is a fork of the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium's repository containing the TEI Guidelines.
Selected branches of that repository are processed by the [Jenkins continuous integration service](https://jenkins-paderborn.tei-c.org/view/LingSIG/) maintained by Peter Stadler at the University of Paderborn.

The LingSIG has had its home page at the [TEI Wiki](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php?title=SIG:TEI_for_Linguists).

Some resources are still present at the [LingSIG project at SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lingsig/files/Documents/) (years ago, SF was the home for open-source development, hosting the TEI Guidelines among other valuable projects).
